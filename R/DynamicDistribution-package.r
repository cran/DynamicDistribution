#' @title Dynamic graphs for discrete and continuous distributions
#' @description This package intends to perform how the probability 
#' density functions(probability mass functions for discrete distributions) 
#' and  numeral characteristics change as the parameters change using a dynamic
#'  method.
#'  @details The most important function is DynCon and DynDis. These two 
#'  functions are used to perform the result. The valid distributions in this 
#'  package are  Inverse_Gaussian, Exponential, Normal, Negative_Binomial, 
#'  Lognormal, Logistic, Con_Uniform, Bernoull, Chi_square, Cauchy, Binomial, 
#'  Beta_dis, Rayleigh, Dis_Uniform, Logarithmic_Series, Laplace, Geometric, 
#'  Gamma_dis, F_dis, Hypergeometric, Pareto, Poisson, Student_t. And the valid
#'   numeral characteristics are cdf, Mean, Variance, Mode, Skewness, Kurtosis.
#'  You will meet two different symbols, "o" and "x" on the graphs of numeral 
#'  characteristics. The former means the numeral characteristic exists, but 
#'  the latter means not, so we set it to 0.
